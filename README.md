# ERCF-Buffer-Array

The Carrot Patch for the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder has an integrated spool holder included. For people who store their spools in a drybox this can be an issue. Either you have to store the buffer ring also in the dry box and takes away space for filament spools, or one has to design a dedicated solution for the buffer ring outside of the dry box.

The Buffer Array solves this issue by dropping the spool holder and allows stacking up buffer ring side by side. One buffer ring element takes up 4cm of space (width). The Buffer Array is based on a modified main body so that all other required parts of the carrot patch can be re-used. 

Building a Buffer Array from skratch of length N>1 requires:
- 1x Buffer Array start
- (N-2)x Buffer Array middle
- 1x Buffer Array end
- recommended for stability: for every 3 buffer elements 3 triple locker
- 1x M5x30mm and 1x m5 lock nut
- 1x M3x20mm, 1x M3x8mm, 1x M3 heat insert (Voron version M3x5x4)
- 608ZZ bearing

If you already have old carrot patches then you can recycle all parts except the heat inserts.
If you want only N=1 then there is also a stand-alone version available.
