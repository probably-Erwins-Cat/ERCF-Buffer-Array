# ERCF-Buffer-Array

The Carrot Patch for the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder has an integrated spool holder included. For people who store their spools in a drybox this can be an issue. Either you have to store the buffer ring also in the dry box and takes away space for filament spools, or one has to design a dedicated solution for the buffer ring outside of the dry box.

The Buffer Array solves this issue by dropping the spool holder and allows stacking up buffer ring side by side. One buffer ring element takes up 4cm of space (width). The Buffer Array is based on a modified main body so that all other required parts of the carrot patch can be re-used. 

A Buffer Array of length N requires:
- 1x Buffer Array start
- (N-2)x Buffer Array middle
- 1x Buffer Array end
- recommended for stability: for every 3 buffer elements 3 triple locker
